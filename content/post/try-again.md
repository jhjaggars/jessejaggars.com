In a few minutes I'll be traveling back to Dunn to get my second dose
of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine.  Last time (three weeks ago), the
traffic was amazing.  Possiblly the worst I had ever seen.

This time my wife is going too and we have a plan to let me disembark
near the site and she will find a place to park that is easy to get
to.

It feels like one of those plans that sounds very clever in advance
but might go poorly because everyone else has the same idea.  We shall
see.
