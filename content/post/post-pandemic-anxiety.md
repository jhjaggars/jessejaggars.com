I got my second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Friday.
The trip was slightly annoying, but ultimately less frustrating than the
first shot.  I've been having mild side-effects which isn't really
noteworthy, but some folks like to keep score I guess.

As I was making the journey I spent some time thinking about 'going back
to normal'. And while I know that's not a good description of what to
expect, it still helped me into a more anxious state of mind.  I _enjoy_
being a bit of a hermit.  For the past year or so, it has been more
socially acceptable to stay in and avoid typical social interactions.

Now, as more and more folks become immunized, the norms of society will
shift towards less reclusion which is good, but it means I have to shed
this remarkable comfort I've been enjoying.  This sounds crazy right?

Now, I would be lying if I said that remaining relatively isolated has
made me *happy*. I'm certainly not any happier than I was prior, and if
I try very hard I think I was actually much more upbeat before all of
this really took hold in the United States.  I think what I'm actually
feeling is more like a return to healthy behavior after having fallen
off the wagon.

Overcoming whatever amount of social anxiety that I do have requires
work.  It requires conciously wrestling with constant self-doubt.  And
for the past year I've basically been allowed to ignore those feelings
from inside my bubble, and that means the _muscle_ used to keep that
feeling in check has atrophied and is very weak.

I *know* that it gets easier to be in public, and that the only real
consequences of my feelings are self-inflicted suffering, but it's still
challenging to get back on the horse.
