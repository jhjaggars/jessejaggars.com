I'll receive my second dose of the Pfizer Sars-Cov-2 vaccine on Wednesday and
I'm feeling pretty mixed about it.

On one hand, I feel great that I'm on my way to be about as protected as I can
be against the disease as well as reducing my chances at spreading it to
others.

On the other, my son cannot be vaccinated (he's three), and so many other
people have suffered over the past year, that it's just plain hard to be elated.

At the end of the day, though, it's the best thing to do and there really is no
alternative.  And so, onward we go.
