For as long as I can remember, I've suffered from a condition where I assume
that if *I* know something, everyone else must know it too.

I think it stems from the feeling that I'm not especially knowledgeable, nor do
I think I've had a novel existence (no really, I haven't).

In fact, as I've aged I've come to relize that I know less and less, by the
second it seems!  Perhaps, because of that I still fall into the trap of
assuming others benefit from a shared context with me.

If I had to guess, I'd say that the majority of the time and effort spent in
conveying a technically complex idea to another person is spent building
context for the idea.  An analogy would be the construction of a jig used to
produce a tricky cut for a woodworking project.  The jig has to be designed to
convey the specific producedure to the material in just the right way, and
after having done so, the jig might go forever unused.

I've tried to take short cuts.  I catch myself trying to summarize an idea at
an amazingly high level, which sometimes works, but often leads me into a
situation where an astute member of the audience will ask a "what about
this..." sort of question.  This is good and bad; it's good in that I know that
the listener was indeed absorbing the information and thinking critically about
it (usually the point of the conversation), but it indicates that maybe I
should have just tried to set the context up in the first place.
