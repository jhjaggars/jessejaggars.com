  <p>I use <a href="">Truenas</a> at home for storage.  I use it for backups and volumes for my
local kubernetes setup.  While, it&rsquo;s really neat to have a backup target at
home, that&rsquo;s insufficient to ensure that I can recover from a serious failure
or disaster so I also have an offsite backup configured.</p>
<p>My first pass at accomplishing this was to synchronize my data to amazon s3
glacier.  It was pretty easy to configure, but I am clearly not smart enough to
read the fine print and ended up running up a large bill.. somehow.  The best
part is how smart felt before I realized my error, so awesome.  I decided to
abandon that plan and try out storj, which also has an integration built
directly into truenas.  Easy!</p>
