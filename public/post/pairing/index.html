in my day job. My new role gives me an opportunity to work on code regularly
again so I&rsquo;ve been looking for reasonable projects to jump into. There is no
shortage of work, but I want to make sure that I don&rsquo;t get too much into the
critical path since I won&rsquo;t be able to devote my full attention to working on a
single task for long.</p><p>So, to summarize, I have time to work on software, my team has plenty of
software work to go around, and I haven&rsquo;t done it in a while. My conclusion is
that I need a plan to be impactful, learn, and not get in the way.</p><p>I have done a good bit of pair programming in the past and have always found it
to be enjoyable and a productive method for my work projects. I think that if I
can find the right opportunity to pair on a high-impact issue that it would be
ideal, so I pitched it to a colleague.</p><p>The person I reached out to is an archtect on one of the major systems in my
organization and the conversation went something like this:</p><blockquote><p>me: Hey, do you work on issues regularly?</p><p>them: No, not really.</p><p>me: Do you want to?</p><p>them: Sure!</p><p>me: Have you ever tried pair programming?</p><p>them: I&rsquo;ve shared my screen and had someone look over my shoulder and
criticize me as I tried to work on a bit of code before, so yeah.</p><p>me: Oh, that&rsquo;s not what I was thinking&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>I think it&rsquo;s pretty common for someone who has never paired before to have some
anxiety about the activity. It&rsquo;s really easy to feel judged or insecure when
you know someone is watching you work very closely. So I think it&rsquo;s really
important to build a bubble of psychological safety</p><p>Luckily, my colleague is a good sport and agreed to try pairing with me even
after his less than ideal previous experience.</p><p>We used <a href=https://tmate.io/>tmate</a> to share a tmux session. I had my colleague
host the session so that we&rsquo;d be using his tools on his system, and before we
got started I told him &ldquo;the rules&rdquo;:</p><ol><li>There is a driver and a navigator</li><li>Before switching roles, the navigator will say something like &ldquo;let me drive for a bit&rdquo;.</li></ol><p>We worked for about two hours and were able to make enough progress to reach a
stopping point we were both happy with. After, my colleague mentioned that it
was much more enjoyable than he expected and he was glad we decided to do it.</p><p>The experience got me to thinking about what I believe are the benefits of the practice.</p><ul><li>Reduces the &ldquo;bus factor&rdquo;, meaning more than one person now understands how somethe thing works</li><li>All participants learn and teach each other things about how they work</li><li>Improved quality for the next person(s) to touch the project</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m sure there are some other ones, but to me, the above points are hard to deny.</p><nav class=page-nav><a class=page-nav__previous-link href=/post/boinc/>Prev: BOINC</a>
