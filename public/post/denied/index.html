I showed up
on time with my documentation, and handed it over to the lady behind the
sign-up desk.</p><p>She took a quick look at my card, and asked me if I had already had my first
shot. It seemed odd to me that she would ask, because I just presented my card
as evidence that I had.</p><p>Then she asked, &ldquo;Where did you receive your first dose?&rdquo;. Immediately, I knew
something was about to go sideways. I told her, and she said &ldquo;Let me go check
on this.&rdquo;.</p><p>Moments later, she and another lady came back to me and said that they were
&ldquo;unable&rdquo; to administer the second dose to me because I got my first dose in a
different location. She provided the following as an extended justification:
&ldquo;People have been going all over for their first dose and then coming here for
the second dose and we are short.&rdquo;</p><p>My initial reaction, as is usual in these sorts of situations, was to simply
provide an ack and depart. On the way back home though I got a little angry,
and I feel like it&rsquo;s mostly misplaced. I&rsquo;m upset with Duke for not giving me a
heads up about the policy, but the rest of my negativity isn&rsquo;t resting in the
right place yet I don&rsquo;t think.</p><p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll be returning to the spot where I got my first shot in a couple
days to finish my course.</p><div><div>Tags:</div><ul><li><a href=/tags/covid/>Covid</a></li></ul></div><nav class=page-nav><a class=page-nav__previous-link href=/post/try-again/>Prev: Try Again</a>
