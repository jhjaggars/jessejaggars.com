The trip was slightly annoying, but ultimately less frustrating than the
first shot. I&rsquo;ve been having mild side-effects which isn&rsquo;t really
noteworthy, but some folks like to keep score I guess.</p><p>As I was making the journey I spent some time thinking about &lsquo;going back
to normal&rsquo;. And while I know that&rsquo;s not a good description of what to
expect, it still helped me into a more anxious state of mind. I <em>enjoy</em>
being a bit of a hermit. For the past year or so, it has been more
socially acceptable to stay in and avoid typical social interactions.</p><p>Now, as more and more folks become immunized, the norms of society will
shift towards less reclusion which is good, but it means I have to shed
this remarkable comfort I&rsquo;ve been enjoying. This sounds crazy right?</p><p>Now, I would be lying if I said that remaining relatively isolated has
made me <em>happy</em>. I&rsquo;m certainly not any happier than I was prior, and if
I try very hard I think I was actually much more upbeat before all of
this really took hold in the United States. I think what I&rsquo;m actually
feeling is more like a return to healthy behavior after having fallen
off the wagon.</p><p>Overcoming whatever amount of social anxiety that I do have requires
work. It requires conciously wrestling with constant self-doubt. And
for the past year I&rsquo;ve basically been allowed to ignore those feelings
from inside my bubble, and that means the <em>muscle</em> used to keep that
feeling in check has atrophied and is very weak.</p><p>I <em>know</em> that it gets easier to be in public, and that the only real
consequences of my feelings are self-inflicted suffering, but it&rsquo;s still
challenging to get back on the horse.</p><nav class=page-nav><a class=page-nav__previous-link href=/post/btrfs-is-awesome/>Prev: Btrfs Is Awesome</a>
