<p>Over the past couple of years I have collected some computing devices and put them to use doing various self-hosting things and some educational stuff as well.  The goal of this post is to give a broad overview of what I&rsquo;ve been up to and some of my motivations that led me to where I am now.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say the first &lsquo;full-time&rsquo; self-hosted thing I launched was a server to run <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a>.  I used a raspberry pi 4 and the <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#diy-with-raspberry-pi">diy image</a> running on a small thumb drive.  I remember reading somewhere that the speed differences between usb3 and the sdcard interface would be noticible so that&rsquo;s why I went that route.</p>
<p>I built up a small collection of iot devices and managed them all via Home Assistant.  I also utilized the homekit bridge integration to present a subset of devices to the Home app on my wife and I&rsquo;s iPhones.  We are still making good use of Home Assistant today.</p>

<p>At some point around 2016 or so I picked up a <a href="">Dell T30</a> with the intention of running some VM stuff for work.  It had been sitting mostly unused for years when I decided to try out <a href="">TrueNAS</a>.  I added a couple 4 TB disks and installed TrueNAS and have been running it ever since.  We used this system as a backup target for our personal laptops initially, and now I use it for all sorts of stuff which I&rsquo;ll get to later.  At one point I decided to upgrade from Core to Scale and I thought the upgrade process was magical.  I&rsquo;ve made a <a href="">couple of upgrades</a> to make the system even more useful for remote clients.  There are a couple of downsides to this system though, the form factor and the lack of disk capacity are eventually going to limit the usefulness of this system.</p>

<p>I got a good deal on an 11th generation Intel NUC on ebay and installed <a href="">Proxmox</a> on it.  I quickly decided I wanted to try managing a few more machines and built a system around a [free ryzen 3800xt] one of my friends gave me.  I ran a 2 node Proxmox cluster for a while, until I found another NUC at a great price on ebay, which allowed me to expand to 3 nodes.</p>
<p>Along the way, I set up <a href="">K3S</a> on top of VMs and have been on that journey ever since.</p>
<p>I got very excited by the meteor lake mobile processors from Intel and grabbed a new ASROCK 155H system and included it in my setup later.  Notable for this system is that I added it as a bare metal worker node for my k8s cluster, and I did not install ProxMox on it.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="racking">
  Racking
  <a class="anchor" href="#racking">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I have a 15U rack that I have been putting most of my equipment into.  I decided on this because it fits nicely under my workbench in my office and it is open and easy to work with.  I&rsquo;ve added an <a href="">8-port KVM switch</a> and a very useful <a href="">rackmount KVM</a> from Ebay.  Prior to this I was using a <a href="">4 port EzCoo KVM switch</a> and a portable monitor as a sort of crash cart.  Once I moved beyond 4 physical machines I decided to go with the current setup.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="power">

  <a class="anchor" href="#power">#</a>
</h3>
<p>I have a total of 3 UPS devices.  One for my workstation, one for the rack, and one for the network equipment.  I acquired the workstation UPS many years ago and I <a href="">replaced the battery</a> recently to keep it working well.  I <a href="">monitor</a> all of the devices with Network UPS tools.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="networking">
  Networking
  <a class="anchor" href="#networking">#</a>

<p>I started with a mesh wifi setup from <a href="">Eero</a>, then expanded to a small desktop switch in my office, then to a <a href="">Unifi UDM Pro</a> and <a href="">more switches</a>.  I&rsquo;ve recently consolidated down to two switches, and enabled 2.5GbE networking across the house.</p>
